# Game Report: The Firewall Awakens

## Game Overview

- **Game Title**: The Firewall Awakens  
- **Genre**: Strategy / Tactical  
- **Platform(s)**: PC  
- **Release Date**: 26/01/2025  

### Game Description

The Firewall Awakens is an immersive tower defense game set on a high-tech spacecraft, where players must defend the central server from waves of incoming digital threats. The game is set in a futuristic universe where cyber-attacks take on physical form, and players are tasked with strategically deploying defensive cannons to protect the server from being corrupted or destroyed.

Enemies, spawned from a mysterious portal, advance towards the central server, attempting to breach its security systems. Initially, players have a limited amount of coins, which they can use to buy various types of senders, receivers, and defenses, such as firewalls, antivirus turrets, and brute force blockers. As players progress, they can earn additional coins by answering cybersecurity-related questions, providing them with the opportunity to improve their defenses.

The game takes place on a spacecraft, and the battlefield consists of two types of tiles: white tiles, where players can place their defenses, and black tiles, which are inaccessible. The player must carefully plan their defense strategy, utilizing the available white tiles to stop the advancing enemies before they reach the central server.

# Gameplay Info

1. **Primary Objective**  
   The main goal in **The Firewall Awakens** is to **protect the central server** from waves of incoming cyber-attacks. If the server is destroyed by the enemy, the game ends. Players must strategically place defenses to stop these attacks and keep the server intact.

2. **Wave System**  
   - The game is divided into waves of cyber-attacks. Each wave introduces new and increasingly difficult enemies.  
   - After the completion of a wave, there is a **30-second gap** before the next wave starts. During this time, players can:
     - Place new defenses or reposition existing ones.
     - Cast spells to boost the server’s defense or health.
     - Sell previously purchased defenses to recover coins and reallocate resources.

3. **Survival Mode**  
   The game operates on a survival mechanism. Players must defend the server for as long as possible against an increasing number of waves. With each passing wave, the enemies become faster, stronger, and more numerous. Players will need to adjust their strategies to survive longer and protect the server from total destruction.

4. **Selling and Repositioning Defenses**  
   Players can **sell** any previously placed defenses. This allows for:

   - Players earn **coins** through:
     - **Senders** and **Receivers**, which act as the primary source of income over time.
     - Answering **cybersecurity trivia questions**, which reward players with coins for correct answers.
   - **Coins** can be used to:
     - Buy new **higher-power guns** to strengthen defenses.
     - **Buy more guns** to place multiple defenses on the battlefield.
     - **Cast spells** to enhance the server's protection or repair its health.
   - **Strategic placement** of defenses is key to the player's success. Players must think carefully about where to place defenses to maximize their effectiveness.

7. **Game Progression**  
   - As players advance through waves, they face **tougher enemies** and **more complex challenges**.
   - With each new wave, the enemies’ behaviors and attack patterns become more sophisticated, requiring players to rethink and refine their defense strategies.
   
8. **Game Controls**
   - **Movement**:  
     Use **W**, **A**, **S**, **D** to move around.

## Game Features

### 1. Core Gameplay Mechanics

- **Player Controls**:  
  Players interact with the game by placing cannon defenses on the white tiles of the spacecraft. Each defense costs coins, which can be earned by defeating enemies or answering cybersecurity questions. Players can drag and drop defenses onto the grid and select specific cannon types to counter the enemies' different attack patterns. When buying a cannon, players must set a password. The **strength of the password** directly affects the properties of the defense; the stronger the password, the better the properties of the cannon (e.g., higher damage, greater range, faster fire rate).  

- **Objective**:  
  The main goal is to protect the central server from waves of attackers that spawn from the enemy portal. Players must prevent enemies from reaching and corrupting the server by deploying and upgrading defenses along the white tiles.  

- **Power-ups / Collectibles**:  
  Players earn coins in the following ways:
  - **Answering cybersecurity trivia questions**: Players can earn extra coins by answering questions correctly.
  - **Senders and Receivers**: These act as continuous income generators, providing steady coin earnings.  
  Coins can be used to spawn new defenses, buy higher-power guns, or cast spells. Power-ups include temporary boosts like extra damage, faster cannon firing speed, or additional resources.

- **Game Difficulty**:  
  As players progress, the game becomes progressively more challenging with tougher enemies, faster waves, and larger numbers of attackers. The complexity of the cybersecurity questions also increases, providing a deeper learning experience.

- **Environment Design**:  
  The spacecraft battlefield is divided into white tiles where players can place their defenses and black tiles that are unusable. Enemies spawn from a portal, and the battlefield evolves over time as new threats appear. The central server, which players must defend, is represented by a large, glowing hub in the center of the grid.  

- **Character Design**:  
  The game focuses on digital enemy designs that represent different types of cyber-attacks. These include brute force attackers, DDoS bots, malware drones, and AI infiltrators. Each enemy has unique behavior and attack patterns, requiring players to use different defense strategies.  

### 3. Audio and Sound

- **Soundtrack**:  
  The game features an electronic, futuristic soundtrack with ambient synth music, building tension as waves of enemies approach the central server. The music intensifies during moments of high action, such as when enemies reach the server or when the player answers a question correctly.  

- **Sound Effects**:  
  Key sound effects include the charging sounds of the defense cannons, the whirring noise of incoming enemies, alarm notifications when enemies are about to reach the server, and the satisfying sound of enemies being defeated. Distinct sound effects are also played when players answer cybersecurity questions correctly, rewarding them with coins.  

### 4. User Interface (UI) and Menus
